            As a small nonprofit, working with Conscious was our first time ever contracting with an outside company to
            assist with our communications strategy, development, and planning. We really appreciated their patience and willingness to adapt
            to the unique needs of our organization, and we are very happy with the progress that we've made with the Conscious team!
